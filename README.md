## Project Introduction and Objective

The main purpose of this project is to do statistical analysis of housing prices and develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California based on various features. By analyzing historical housing data, we aim to create an accurate prediction model that can assist in real estate valuation and market analysis. This project has potential applications in the real estate industry, urban planning, and economic forecasting.

## Project Description

This project focuses on statistical analysis and predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. We are using the California Housing dataset, which contains information on various housing attributes across different districts in California.

Dataset details:
- Source: [California Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- Number of instances: 20,640
- Number of features: 8
- Target variable: Median house value

Key features include:
- Median income
- Housing median age
- Average rooms
- Average bedrooms
- Population
- Average occupancy
- Latitude
- Longitude

Our main research questions include:
1. What factors have the strongest influence on housing prices in California?
2. How accurately can we predict housing prices using machine learning models?
3. Are there any geographical patterns in housing prices across California?

We will be using various regression models, including Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression and Random Forest, to predict housing prices. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Challenges we anticipate include handling outliers, dealing with potential multicollinearity among features, and capturing complex relationships between variables and housing prices.
