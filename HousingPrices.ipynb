    "    - Median House Value: The distribution is right-skewed, with most houses priced below $300,000. The mean value is slightly higher than the median, showing the influence of higher-priced houses.\n",
    "    - Median Income: The median income distribution is also right-skewed, with the majority of households earning between $2,000 and $5,000 (in tens of thousands), indicating some high-income households skewing the average.\n",
    "1. **Relationship Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Median Income vs. Median House Value: The scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship between income and house value. Higher income tends to lead to higher house values, as demonstrated by a distinct upward trend in the plot.\n",
    "    - Geospatial Relationship: House values and incomes are significantly higher near the coast, particularly in areas like Los Angeles and the Bay Area, emphasizing the importance of location in determining house prices.\n",
    "1. **Correlation Heatmap**:\n",
    "    - The correlation heatmap shows that median income has a strong positive correlation with median house value (0.64). Other features such as total rooms, population, and households exhibit strong internal correlations but have limited predictive power for housing prices.\n",
    "1. **Box Plot Analysis by Ocean Proximity**:\n",
    "    - The box plot of median house value by ocean proximity shows that properties ISLAND, NEAR BAY, and NEAR OCEAN have much higher median values compared to INLAND properties. The coastal proximity of properties significantly increases their value.\n",
    "1. **Pair Plot Analysis**:\n",
    "    - The pair plot reveals a strong positive correlation between median income and median house value, whereas relationships between other features like total rooms and median house value are less distinct. The distributions on the diagonal further confirm the skewness seen in earlier analyses.\n",
    "1. **Heatmap**:\n",
    "    - The heatmap provided an interactive visualization of house values across California. Hotspots of high median house values were observed along the coast, particularly near the Bay Area and Southern California. This visualization provided an intuitive understanding of how geography impacts housing prices, reinforcing the importance of location."
